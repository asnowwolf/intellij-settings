      <item value="According to the Material design spec button text has to be capitalized, however we have opted not to capitalize buttons automatically via `text-transform: uppercase`, because it can cause issues in certain locales. It is also worth noting that using ALL CAPS in the text itself causes issues for screen-readers, which will read the text character-by-character. We leave the decision of how to approach this to the consuming app." />
